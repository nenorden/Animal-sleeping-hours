# Animal-sleeping-hours
Mini-project 1, MATH4432

The features are apparently defined like this (although especially the values of "danger" are weird):

species: species of animal
body: body weight in kg
brain: brain weight in g
slow-wave sleep: slow wave ("nondreaming") sleep (hrs/day)
dream sleep: paradoxical ("dreaming") sleep (hrs/day)
total sleep: total sleep (hrs/day)  (sum of slow wave and paradoxical sleep)
life: maximum life span (years)
gestation:gestation time (days)

predation:
predation index (1-5)(how likely to be preyed upon)
1 = minimum (least likely to be preyed upon)
5 = maximum (most likely to be preyed upon)

sleep exposure:

sleep exposure index (1-5)
1 = least exposed (e.g. animal sleeps in a
well-protected den)
5 = most exposed

danger:
overall danger index (1-5)
(based on the above two indices and other information)
1 = least danger (from other animals)
5 = most danger (from other animals)
